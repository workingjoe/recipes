For making this in bulk, the recipe below will make a total of 750 servings of an
LMNT Citrus Salt clone.  You can store this in a large container and scoop it out
with a properly sized spoon for the correct serving size.  product links are below.

* 600 g (21.2 oz or 1.22 lb) [Morton lite salt](https://a.co/d/9wBgBsV)
* 300 g (10.6 oz or 0.66 lb) [magnesium malate powder](https://a.co/d/aCr6nCW)
* 1,564 g (55.2 oz or 3.45 lb) [non-iodized table salt](https://a.co/d/giOETTm)
* 1,125 g (39.7 oz or 2.5 lb) [citric acid](https://a.co/d/2wtiCJ6)
* 1,500 g (52.9 oz or 3.3 lb) [lemon juice powder](https://a.co/d/3b5na4F)
* 120 g (4.2 oz or 1/4 lb) [pure stevia powder](https://a.co/d/iBK0XUt)

#what I did
---
* Did a 1/6 qty as follows:
* 100g lite-salt
* 50g Mag Malate
* 260g non-iodized salt
* 190g citric-acid powder
* 10g vitamin-c powder (optional)
* 250g or more of Lime Powder
* 20g stevia

Mixing these all together in the quantities listed will yield a weight of about 6.8 g per serving.  
Find a measuring spoon that will scoop out precisely this amount of powder per scoop and keep
it in the same container, and youâ€™ll be good to go!  
The biggest proportion of the cost here is the lemon juice powder, so if you can find a 
less-expensive version of that, the cost per serving will go down even more.

#WHAT ABOUT ALLULOSE?

To replace 120g of Stevia with allulose in your drink mix, you will need approximately **34,286 grams (or 34.3 kilograms)** of allulose.

Here's a breakdown of how we arrive at this calculation:

### **Sweetness Comparison**

* **Stevia:** Stevia is significantly sweeter than regular table sugar, estimated to be about **200 to 400 times sweeter**. For our calculation, we will use the conservative estimate of 200 times sweeter.
* **Allulose:** Allulose is a bit less sweet than sugar, about **70% as sweet as sugar**.

---

### **The Math Behind the Substitution**

1.  **Stevia to Sugar:** First, we'll determine the equivalent amount of sugar for the 120g of Stevia in your recipe. Since Stevia is 200 times sweeter, we multiply the amount of Stevia by 200:
    * $120 \text{g Stevia} \times 200 = 24,000 \text{g sugar}$

2.  **Sugar to Allulose:** Now, we need to find out how much allulose provides the same sweetness as 24,000g of sugar. Since allulose is only 70% as sweet, we'll need more of it. We can calculate this by dividing the sugar amount by 0.70:
    * $24,000 \text{g sugar} / 0.70 \approx 34,285.7 \text{g allulose}$

Therefore, you'll need approximately **34,286 grams** of allulose to match the sweetness of 120g of Stevia.

**Important Note:** This is a very large quantity of allulose, and it's important to consider that replacing Stevia with allulose will significantly change the volume and texture of your drink mix. Allulose also has some different properties from Stevia, such as browning when heated. You may want to start with a smaller batch to test the results and adjust to your taste.
