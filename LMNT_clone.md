#what I did
---
* Did a 1/6 qty as follows:
* 100g lite-salt
* 50g Mag Malate
* 260g non-iodized salt
* 190g citric-acid powder
* 10g vitamin-c powder (optional)
* 250g or more of Lime Powder
* 20g stevia

Mixing these all together in the quantities listed will yield a weight of about 6.8 g per serving.  
Find a measuring spoon that will scoop out precisely this amount of powder per scoop and keep
it in the same container, and youâ€™ll be good to go!  
The biggest proportion of the cost here is the lemon juice powder, so if you can find a 
less-expensive version of that, the cost per serving will go down even more.
